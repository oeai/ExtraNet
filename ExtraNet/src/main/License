[I want to implement a new kind of multi license with everyone who joined or somehow
eventually submitted code and efferts for this project 2013.09.11]
The License of this program is pretty much LGPL alike
maybe with some modifications, also for the used third-party code it is better to follow their rules or whatever included in license
i will post some code links here as well, so authors could be mentioned at least and this way i will not mention
those code snippets in the code itself, because sometimes it is annoying to see those copyrights,
can you get copyright for used letters or native language, air, water, sun, your life?

i will post license text here as well


so right now in the beginning
i've taken the samsung code of wifi-direct

==================
 * this code i found at samsung website, it is called nfcMediaShare, but since i think to modify it
 * i guess some names should be modified also and i have to warn, that this code may be incompatible
 * with original code after some time or somehow extended
 * first of all because of security issues and high need of low traffic, so some functions will be disabled probs
 * the original link http://developer.samsung.com/android/samples/NFC-Media-Share
http://developer.samsung.com/android/samples/NFC-Media-Share posted here
for classes

- NFCManager
- NFCMediaShare
- TransferManager
- WiFiDirectMAnager

==================

i'm thinking if using for wi-fi hotspot init classes


==================

==================
https://github.com/ymerdawe/wifihunter
searches wifi hot spots - others can do such as well

==================


==================
https://github.com/ericwangtengyu/WifiLocator
can be interesting to find distance between devices

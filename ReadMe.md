eXtraNet XN0.01

ExtraSense NetWork is a wifi based mesh environment for android where people could communicate with each other without the need of external internet connection.
some kind of FidoNet - extraSenses gonna be like bbs-sysops and people communicating through them - bbs-users,
but since there's no actual need in sysops (except being moderators for some users) because a lot of people have internet access
users will be like points and just collaborate with coordinators, and sysops just being hubs for offline local users (in fact i didn't use Fido)
just to simplify more and use latest technologies extrasense network will provide some communication layer for very
few text-based protocols like mail, jabber, icq, irc, feeds using it's own local basic-jabber-service probably with some user-services maybe
but since this concerns some private data transmitted through other users, these services will be available through trusted users only (friends or their friends)
so it wont be available right out of the box, but after some time of use with friends

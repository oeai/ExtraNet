 WARNING this program cannot be used for any harm or bad use, illegal (unlawful) or criminal purposes, violent or antisocial behaviour.

Because of this warning i've stopped to think on this project, you should not doing such thing because of too much of agression this time
having such network can increase violence and crimes

here's raw basic

* [Правила](https://github.com/oeai/ExtraNet/wiki/%D0%9F%D1%80%D0%B0%D0%B2%D0%B8%D0%BB%D0%B0)

that cannot be violated in any such network by no means, maybe it will be modified into jedi codex or whatever

this will not be the anonymous network, so every message could be identified that is much simplier to work with for many cases
but also this is a potential leak, so i got to think more on it.

    if you are a hacker or programmer
    don't help to do any crime or mods for some persons
    если ты прогер или хакер
    не помогай совершать преступления,
    не делай модов проги для непонятных людей

ExtraSense NetWork is a wifi based mesh environment for android where people could communicate with each other without the need of external internet connection.
some kind of FidoNet - extraSenses gonna be like bbs-sysops and people communicating through them - bbs-users,
but since there's no actual need in sysops (except being moderators for some users) because a lot of people have internet access
users will be like points and just collaborate with coordinators, and sysops just being hubs for offline local users (in fact i didn't use Fido)
just to simplify more and use latest technologies extrasense network will provide some communication layer for very
few text-based protocols like mail, jabber, icq, irc, feeds using it's own local basic-jabber-service probably with some user-services maybe
but since this concerns some private data transmitted through other users, these services will be available through trusted users only (friends or their friends)
so it wont be available right out of the box, but after some time of use with friends
